## Introduction
Globally, coastal areas including Massachusetts coastal areas are facing the looming threat of sea level rise because of climate change. With Massachusetts having extensive coastline and diverse ecosystems, understanding the vulnerability of these coastal regions to sea level rise is essential. This project aims to analyze and map areas along the coast of Massachusetts that are susceptible to inundation from rising sea levels. By incorporating projections of future sea level rise scenarios, critical infrastructure, residential areas, and ecological habitats at risk can be identified, aiding in informed decision-making and proactive planning efforts.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to assess the vulnerability of coastal areas in Massachusetts to sea level rise specifically 1 meter sea level rise and its associated impacts. By creating detailed maps that visualize areas at risk of inundation under various sea level rise scenarios, stakeholders can better understand the magnitude of the threat and prioritize adaptation and mitigation measures. Additionally, identifying critical infrastructures, residential areas, and ecological habitats that may be impacted allows for targeted interventions to protect assets, safeguard communities, and preserve important ecosystems in the face of climate change.

## Importance
- Helps to quantify vulnerability of coastal areas as well as identifies specific areas of concern facilitating the development of adaptation strategies that minimize risks and maximize societal and ecological benefits.
- It promotes collaboration in implementing solutions that ensure the long-term sustainability and vitality of coastal communities and ecosystems by raising awareness about the impacts of sea level rise and the need for concerted action among diverse stakeholders.
- The project contributes to building a more resilient and climate-resilient future for the state by tackling the challenges posed by sea level rise head-on.
